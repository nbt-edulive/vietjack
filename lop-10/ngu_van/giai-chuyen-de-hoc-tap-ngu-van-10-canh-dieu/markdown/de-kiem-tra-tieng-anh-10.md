**Read the passage below carefully, and then decide whether the statements are true (T), false (F) or not given (N)**

The meanings of the terms _science_ and _technology_ have changed significantly from one generation to another. More similarities than differences, however, can be found between the terms.

Both science and technology imply a thinking process, both are concerned with causal relationships in the material world, and both employ an experimental methodology that results in empirical demonstrations that can be verified by repetition. Science, at least in theory, is less concerned with the practicality of its results and more concerned with the development of general laws, but in practice science and technology are inextricably involved with each other. The varying interplay of the two can be observed in the historical development of such practitioners as chemists, engineers, physicists, astronomers, carpenters, potters, and many other specialists. Differing educational requirements, social status, vocabulary, methodology, and types of rewards, as well as institutional objectives and professional goals, contribute to such distinctions as can be made between the activities of scientists and technologists; but throughout history the practitioners of “pure” science have made many practical as well as theoretical contributions.

**Question 31:** The meanings of the terms science and technology have stayed the same.

**Question 32:** We can find more similarities than differences between the terms.

**Question 33:** Only science implies a thinking process.

**Question 34:** Technology employs a more experimental methodology than that of science.

**Question 35:** Science, at least in theory, is more concerned with the development of general laws and less concerned with the practicality of its results. 

**Question 36:** The changeable relationship of the two can be seen in the historical development of such practitioners as chemists, engineers, physicists, astronomers, carpenters, potters, and many other specialists. 

**Question 37:** There are distinctions between the activities of scientists and technologists.

**Question 38:** Institutional objectives and professional goals do not contribute to such distinctions.

**Question 39:** Throughout history the practitioners of “pure” science have made a lot of practical as well as theoretical contributions.

**Question 40:** The reading above is about science and technology.
